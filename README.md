# The Problem

Have your browser tabs gotten so small that you can't even fit an icon? Fear no more, No Tab Left Behind is here to solve your problems!

## Stops new, wasteful tabs!
No Tab Left Behind watches when you open a Google Drive file, and if you already have it open, it prevents the new duplicate window. Instead, NTLB draws your focus to your existing tab!  Even if its another window!
